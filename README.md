# HIDEFILES
HIDEFILES tool the most advanced tool for hiding folders and files

---you can HIDEFILES on: 
your computer,flash drive or an external hard disk.
you only have to choose what suits you from the options by writing 
the number next to the option, then enter the file path or The folder 
that you want to hide or show.
to know the path of your file, all you have to do is:
go to the file that you want to hide or show and press it with the right click 
and choose -properties- and you will find the file path next to the location, 
but you must pay attention that you must write the name of the file and its format,
For example
we have a file called test, which is an MP4 video in the path C:\Users\ABooD\Desktop,
so you have to modify the path to be as follows: C:\Users\ABooD\Desktop\test.mp4
--Note: It is recommended that you save the file path and its format in a note
because without the path it is impossible to recover the files.
---Note: to run the tool go to dist file and open -hidefiles-
